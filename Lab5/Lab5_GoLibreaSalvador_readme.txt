Description:
  This program implements a C++ function that computes the Manhattan distance between inputted
  points. It first accepts a single integer â€‹denoting the number of test cases. For each test case,
  the program accepts a single integer denoting the number of points for that test case. Subsequently,
  the program accepts the 3 integers (x, y, and z) corresponding to the coordinates of each point. For
  each test case, the Manhattan distance/s between adjacent points is/are outputted.

How to Run and Use the Program:
  1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

  2. Navigate to the directory containing the source file.

  3. Compile the program using a C++ compiler:
    
      g++ -o lab5 Lab5_GoLibrea_Salvador_code.cpp

  4. Run the compiled program: 

      ./lab5
  
  5. Input the number of cases you want to test.

  6. Further enter the relevant and required inputs for each test case.
